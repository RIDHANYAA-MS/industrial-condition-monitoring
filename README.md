# Industrial Equipment Condition Monitoring & Alert Software

This project is a simple software system designed to monitor equipment condition data
and generate alerts when predefined thresholds are exceeded.

The focus of this project is on backend software logic, data handling, and reliability.

## Features
- Reads simulated equipment sensor data
- Checks values against safety thresholds
- Generates alerts for abnormal conditions
- Modular and easy-to-understand code structure

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SQL (simulated)
- Git

## Note
This project uses simulated datasets to focus on software engineering principles.
